And one post in English...For few days I’m developing one jQuery UI plugin. It’s picture gallery which I’ve seen in flash but not in JavaScript, that’s why I decided to fix this. The gallery is a set of rotating pictures and difference ways of handling the perspective. There’s nothing complicated in it just little analytic geometry. I haven’t used any canvases or SVG because I’ve wanted the biggest possible browser compatibility. Of course there’re are drawbacks from this. There are a lot of computations I don’t have hardware acceleration and it works slow in the old version of few browsers. Currently I’m developing webpage for the gallery. Here’s a screenshot of it: <a href="http://carousel.mgechev.com/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96" title="jQCarousel" src="/images/legacy/uploads/2012/02/gallery-logo.png" alt="" width="800" height="279" /></a>  
If you’re interested in the project you can see it’s source or fork it at <a title="jQCarousel GitHub" href="https://github.com/mgechev/jqcarousel" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
