This time I'll violate my principle to write only about purely technical topics in my blog. In the next a couple of paragraphs I'll talk about open source software from a very personal perspective. I'll start by explaining what open source software is and after that we'll discuss it's bright sides and dark corners...

We'll then discuss what's the impact of the open source projects on a more global level. Finally, I'll give a concrete example by briefly describing my personal story - my last two years working on open source software.

*Keep in mind that you don't need any technical background to continue reading this article. All the concepts are (should be) well explained. If anything sounds unfamiliar to you, this is my mistake and I will fix it as soon as possible. To let me know, please comment below or drop me an email.*

# Introduction

What is open source software? There are numerous of definitions online. Here's one:

>Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

In this specific article, I'll discus open source into the context of the one of the least restrictive licenses out there - the MIT license.

In short, open source software means that when you create a program or a module, you release it publicly available. You provide it to the world for free. You release not only the software itself but also its source code. You can think of the source code as the list of instructions which you've typed in order to make the computer to do something. This will allow everyone else with some technical knowledge to copy this software, to modify it, to distribute it by their own, to build it, to use it, to sell it (yes, that's possible), to teach people how to use it...It allows everyone to do anything they want with your software! With your work.

## Giving your work for free...

I know this sounds very absurd to a lot of people. Giving your work for free. Work requires resources, like time, food, water, etc. and these resources are not free. Why would you give your work for free then? This is a mind gap that a lot of people cannot cross.

And the truth is that although there are some open source projects out there which are making money, in the general case, if you are a developer working only on open source, you won't make anything. Again, there are exceptions such as a handful of people working on the Linux Kernel, people working on .NET, or Angular, or VSCode, or TypeScript, etc. However, if you're a developer who spends their time only in maintaining open source projects and creating such, without an organization supporting them, the chances are that you're going to starve.

On the other hand, there are a lot of developers and corporations who are using a lot of open source software and they are making money out of that. In the end, the open source is free, isn't it? Anyone can use it. Then why a corporation should pay their developers to work on something if it's already out there?

## Guilt and Burnouts

We already mentioned that when you're doing open source in your spare time...you're generally working for free. In fact, not only working for free but making money for companies using your projects!

Well, that's not the worst. You're not only giving your spare time without getting paid but also everyone who's using your projects thinks that you're obligated to do so!

I've had a lot of angry people using my projects who have shouted at me because I haven't solved their work problem over my weekend. I've gotten a lot of anger and a lot of hatred from such people...and this is definitely stressful. A lot of other engineers doing open source have discussed this problem and shared their stories. A lot of very smart engineers have completely left the open source world because of that.

Often getting pressured from people, you feel obligated to solve their problems. You feel guilty if you don't. You feel guilty if you don't work on your open source software over the weekend, because there are people who want more features or who have found a bug.

This way, at some point, you feel yourself into a magical circle. You're spinning like a hamster, constantly trying to catch up and make people happy. At some point working on your toy projects is not fun anymore. You just fight with issues and everyday, little by little, your enthusiasm dies.

This is how you **burnout**.

People often say that burnouts happen when you take more work that you can handle. Well, I'm not certain that this is the case. I burnout when I face similar problems over and over again and I don't feel like I am doing any progress. I've experienced this with a few of my work and open source projects. **The best solution for burnouts that I have found is to start something you. Something fun!**

But anyway. These were some of the negatives of working on open source projects. Did I melt even the tiniest enthusiasm you had to start something by your own? Well, do not give up yet. There are also a lot of benefits. Not only personal but also global! Bear with me for a little while!
