title: AngularJS style guide

Today I created a <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-style-guide" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> which contains a set of good practices and style guides for AngularJS application development.

Its main goal is to be community-driven and to concentrate all the best practices for AngularJS development in one place.

I&#8217;ve collected these guidelines mostly from my own experience and the source code of AngularJS. I guess there are missing things thats why I&#8217;ll try to fill the gaps in future. Also, if you find something which can be improved or included feel free to <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-style-guide" target="_blank">contribute</a>.
