title: Using GitHub Pages with Jekyll!

I'm switching to GitHub pages with Jekyll.
There are several reasons behind my decision:

1. Faster! - static HTML is much faster than my old WordPress blog.
2. Lighter - Jekyll is much more minimalistic than WordPress, it has all I need and in the same time it is not too much.
3. I can use VIM! - I can use my favorite text editor in order to:
  - configure my blog
  - write blog posts
4. Reliable hosting - last a couple of yeas I pay for hosting, which is not reliable enough. Last day my blog was offline for a couple of hours because it "exceed the computational resources of my shared hosting", wtf?! Can a wordpress blog do that? Anyway, GitHub pages are going to be the next home of my blog.
