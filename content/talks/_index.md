I like talking about software development. I've spoken in San Francisco, Las Vegas, London, Berlin, Kiev, etc. Here you can find links to some of my recent talks.

If you're looking for speakers for your next JavaScript, Angular, React, etc. related conference you can reach me at **minko at gechev dot io**.
