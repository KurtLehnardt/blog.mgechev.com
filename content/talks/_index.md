![Talks](/images/talks.jpg)

I often speak about software engineering and computer science. Here you can find links to my recent talks. In each cell in the grid, you can find talk title, link to slides and/or video, and flag of the country where the event took place. In some of the events I presented through a video call because of inability to travel.

If you're want me as a speaker on your event reach out to me at **minko at gechev dot io**.
