In this blog post we'll go through a sample implementation of a type checker and interpreter of a very primitive purely functional programming language. This blog post is inspired by the book "[Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/)".

# Semantics

Before going any further, lets show a few samples of the programming language that we're going to develop.
